**THIS (IT IS A KEYWORD)**
+ The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.
**STORING DATA**
+ In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.
# Chapter 5: Document Object Model
+ The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
**THE DOM TREE IS A mODEL OF A WEB PAGE**
+ THE DOCUMENT NODE
+ ELEMENT NODES
**Each node is an object with methods and properties. Scripts access and update this DOM tree (not the source HTML file). Any changes made to the DOM tree are reflected in the browser.**

### WORKING WITHTHE DOM TREE
+ Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
**The terms elements and element nodes are used interchangeably but when people say the DOM is working with an element, it is actually working with a node that represents that element.**
