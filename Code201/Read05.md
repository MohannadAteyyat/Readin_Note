#### Adding Images 
![Image](/Images201/qw1.png)
+ <img>  To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
+ src :This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images â€” relative URLs were covered on pages 83-84).
#### Where to Place Images in Your Code
+ Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:
1. before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
2. inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
3. in the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.
#### Old Code: Aligning Images Horizontally
+ align : The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images.
#### Three Rules for Creating Images
1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution


**The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.**
**Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.**
**Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.**
