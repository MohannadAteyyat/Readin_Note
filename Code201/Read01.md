# HTML & CSS
### Design and Build Websites
## Introduction  
+ Is it hard to Learn? 
- Many books that teach HTML and CSS resemble dull manuals. To make it easier for you to learn, we threw away the traditional template used by publishers and redesigned this book from scratch. 
1. At work, when people look at my screen and see it full of code, it's not unusual to get a comment about it looking very complicated or how clever I must be to understand it. The truth is, it's not that hard to learn how to write web pages and read the code used to create them; you certainly don't have to be a "programmer."
2. Understanding HTML and CSS can help anyone who works with the web; designers can create more attractive and usable sites, website editors can create better content, marketers can communicate with their audience more effectively, and managers can commission better sites and get the best out of their teams.
3. I've focussed on the code you need to use 90% of the time and omitted the code that you would rarely see even if writing websites is your full time job. By the end of the book, if you come across the other 10% you will be able to Google it to find out what it means quickly and easily.
+ How WebsitesAre Created ?
* All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.
# Chapter 1: Structure
![Image](/Images201/a1.png)

+ The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website.
## Structuring Word Documents
+ The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. For example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information.
## HTM L Describes the Structure of Pages
- In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.
- You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen is in black.

### HTM L Us es El ements to Describe the Structure of Pages 
+ Let's look closer at the code from the last page. There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.
+ Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

# Chapter 8: Extra Markup
### The Evolution of HT ML 
+ Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML. 
1. HT ML 4 Released 1997
2. XHTML 1.0 Released 2000
3. HT ML5 Released 2000
### Comments in HT ML 

+ If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
> <!-- comment goes here --> 
#### ID Attribute 
#### Class Attribute 
#### Block Eleme nts 
+ Examples of block elements are 
####  Grouping Text & Eleme nts In a Block 
##### div

### meta
+ The meta element lives inside the head element and contains information about that web page. It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive. (If the page is time sensitive, it can be set to expire.)

# Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout
+ HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.
####  Traditional HTML Layouts
+ For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

#### New Html 5 Layout El ements
+ HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
+ Headers & Footers 
+ The header and footer elements can be used for:
1. The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
2.  A header or footer for an individual article or
 section within the page.
 ### Navigation 
 + The nav element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
 #### Articles 
 + The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
 # Chapter 18: Process & Design 
 + This section discusses a process that you can use when you are creating a new website. 
 * Who is the Site For? 
 + Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
+ Why People Visit YOUR Website

+ What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve 
* Gordon bought a tennis racquet several years ago; now he wants to purchase one from your site for his girlfriend.
+ Molly has read about your new doggy daycare service in the press and wants to find out whether it would be suitable for her to use.
+ Jasper had a bad experience staying in a hotel when visiting Sydney,
+ Australia, and wants to make a complaint. Ayo hopes to study architecture and wants to learn more about a new course that is being offered.
+ Ivy is a picture editor and wants to look at a photographer's site to see examples of his work before deciding whether to commission him.

# JAVASCRIPT 
+ This book explains how JavaScript can be used
in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.

# Chapter 1:The ABC of Programming
+ Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:
![Image](/Images201/a9.png) 

+ A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following:
1. RECIPES
+ By fo llowing the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.
2. HANDBOOKS
+ Large companies often provide handbooks for new employees that contain procedures to fo llow in certain situations.
3. MANUALS
+ Mechanics often refer to car repair manuals when servicing models they are not familiar with. These manuals contain a series of tests to check the key functions of the car are working, along with details of how to fix any issues that arise.
+ HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER
+ Before diving into the JavaScript language, you need to know how it will fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages.
