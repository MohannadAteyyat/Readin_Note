# Chapter 2: Text
+ Headings and paragraphs
+ Bold, italic, emphasis
+ Structural and semantic markup
* When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
+ **Structural** markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
+ ** Semantic** markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

### Semantic Markup
+ Strong & Emphasis
1. Strong 
+ The use of the \<strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.
2. \<em>
+ The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.
### Abbreviations & Acronyms
+ If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the <abbr> element can be used. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.

#### COMMENTS 
- You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
+ /* This script displays a greeting to the user based upon the current time.
It is an example from JavaScript & jQuery book */
- WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
\ A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
