2. A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is createdwith the \<tr> element.
3. Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or \<th> if it is a header).

# Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects
+ WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
**Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).**
- WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
**Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.**

## WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS? 
**Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.**

## Summary
1. Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
2. Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
3. An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
