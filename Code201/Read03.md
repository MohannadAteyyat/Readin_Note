Chapter 3: Lists
## Ordered Lists 
1. <ol>
- The ordered list is created with the <ol> element.
2. <li>
-Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
## UnOrdered Lists 
1. <ul>
- The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
2. <li>
- Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
## Definition Lists 
1. <dl>
- The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
- Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements.
2. <dt>
- This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
3. <dd>
- This is used to contain the definition. Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different

# Chapter 13: Boxes
### Box Dimension ( Width, height)
- By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.
### Limiting Width (min-width, max-width)
- Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

### Limiting Height(min-Height, max-Height)
- In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties.

# Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions
## STATEMENTS
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

## COMMENTS 
+ You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 
+ /* This script displays a greeting to the user based upon the current time.
It is an example from JavaScript & jQuery book */
* WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
- A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.

# Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops
- Looking at a flowchart (for all but the most basic scripts), the code can take more than one path, which means the browser runs different code in different situations. In this chapter, you will learn how to create and control the flow of data in your scripts to handle different situations.
## SWITCH STATEMENTS

## USING SWITCH STATEMENTS
- In this example, the purpose of the switch statement is to present the user with a different message depending on which level they are at.

#### TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING 
* If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sense of the operation rather than report an error.
#### TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES
+ Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and this has some interesting side effects.
#### CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE
- Because the presence of an object or array can be considered truthy, it is often used to check for the existence of an element within a page.
#### SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES
+ Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se).
