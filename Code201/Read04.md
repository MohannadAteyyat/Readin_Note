Chapter 4: Ch.4 Links
+ Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing. 
### Writing Links

### Linking to Other Sites 
+ \<a>
1. Links are created using theelement which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.
2. Users can click on anything that appears between the opening \<a> tag and the closing \</a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.
3. When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL.
### Linking to Other Pages on the Sa me Site

### Directory Structure
+ On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.
### Rela tive UR Ls 
+ Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
### Email Links 
**mailto:**
+ To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.

# Chapter 15: Layout
### In this chapter we are going to look at
+ how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.
1. Explore different ways to position e ●● lements using normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
2. Discover how various devices have different screen sizes and resolution, and how this affects the design process.
3. Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts, and how they are created.
4. Find out how designers use grids to make their page designs look more professional.
## Key Concepts in Positioning El ements
### Building Blocks

### Containing Elements 
+ If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
## Controll ing the Position of El ements 
- CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

- To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

# Chapter 3 (first part): Functions, Methods, and Objects
+ Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce:
1.FUNCTIONS and METHODS



**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**
+ Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

2.OBJECTS

+ **WHAT IS AN OBJECT?**
- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

3.BUILT-IN OBJECTS

- **WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS?**
+ Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming 
-  pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills 

+ **How does pair programming work?**
+ While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
+ **Why pair program?**
- While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

+ Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

* During a five-hour paired lab session, Code Fellows students work on all four of these language-specific skills. The abilities they foster will serve them well in completing assignments, in their own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice.
1. **Greater efficiency**
+  Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging
2. **Engaged collaboration** 
- When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

+ Another important aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help. We advise our students to spend no more than fifteen minutes stuck on a problem before asking a teaching assistant or instructor for help. When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help.
3. **Learning from fellow students**
+ working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.
4. **Social skills**
+ When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. 
5. **Job interview readiness**
- For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.
6. **Work environment readiness**
+ Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
