# Basic writing and formatting syntax
 *Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.
### Headings 
+ To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading. 
### Styling text
+ You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text in comment fields and .md files.

### Links
+ You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
### Section links
* You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link:

## Mentioning people and teams 
- You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name. For more information about notifications, see "[About notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications)."

# Getting Started with GitHub Pages 
+ GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages’ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer. 
1. Create Your Website

2. On the new repository screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website. 
+ Your website’s files will live in a repository named username.github.io (where “username” is your actual GitHub user name). To begin setting up your site, you have to open the Settings tab

3. If you scroll down on the settings page, you’ll see the GitHub Pages section near the bottom. Click the Choose a theme button to start the process of creating your site.

4. Once you’ve clicked the button, you’ll be directed to the Theme Chooser. You’ll see several theme options in a carousel across the top of the page. Click on the images to preview the themes. Once you’ve selected one, click Select theme on the right to move on. It’s easy to change your theme later, so if you’re not sure, just choose one for now.
+ Here’s where you’ll write your own content (You can keep the default content for now, if you’d like). 



+ GitHub does all the work to direct visitors to username.github.io to view your new website. This can take up to 10 minutes. After some time has passed, you can open a new tab in your browser to go to your site!

#### Making Changes 
+ One of the first things you can do is remove the default title of your index page, and add a friendlier message to it. Since this is a very quick change – and your first one – you’re going to make it on the default branch: main. 
- View the _config.yml file by navigating to it in the Code tab. You can edit the file by clicking on the pencil icon. 
#### Next Steps
+ Just because you’ve made some changes into your project doesn’t mean you should stop! Check out these other guides to learn how to contribute to other projects or perfect the way you work on projects:
