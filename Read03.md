## HTML5 Layout
- HTML5 layout elements
- How old browsers understand new elements
- Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS
### HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.
* They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These
new elements are going to play an important part in creating
layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:
1. The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
2. How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
3. How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
## Traditional HTML Layouts
* For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
## New Html5 Layout Elements

+ HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.
## Headers & Footers
### The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
*  The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
* A header or footer for an
individual <article> or <section> within the page

## Extra Markup
* X Specifying different versions of HTML
* Identifying and grouping elements
* Comments, meta information and iframes
## The Evolution of HTML
* Each new version was designed
to be an improvement on the
last (with new elements and
attributes added and older code
removed).
- There have also been several
versions of each browser used to
view web pages, each of which
implements new code. Not all
web users, however, have the
latest browsers installed on
their computers, which means
that not everyone will be able to
view all of the latest features and
markup.
+ Where you should be
particularly aware of browsers
not supporting certain features,
I have made a note of this (as
you have seen with some of the
HTML5 elements introduced in
the Forms chapter â€” and as you
will see in the CSS chapters).

## Grouping Text & Elements In a Block <div>
* The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
* For example, you might create a <div> element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the navigation), or you might create a <div> element to contain comments from visitors.
+ In a browser, the contents of the <div> element will start on a new line, but other than this it will make no difference to the presentation of the page.
